Blender CAM is an open source solution for artistic CAM - Computer aided machining - a g-code generation tool.

Blender CAM is an extension for the free open-source Blender 3d package.

It has been used for many milling projects, and is actively developed. If you are a developer who would like to help, don't hesistate to contact me.

This extension is free of charge, however you can donate to support the development and appreciate the work which has allready been done.
There is currently no warranty for the results from blender CAM - you have to check your paths before use. Blender CAM has been tested with success in my studio. I wouldn't recommend Blender CAM for metalworking now, be carefull if you try it.
